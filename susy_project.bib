  abstract={This report emphasizes the comparison between supersymmetric models and experiments. A minimal theoretical introduction is included as a guide to the interpretation of results. The existing constraints from low energy measurements, accelerator searches (LEP, Tevatron and HERA) and non-accelerator searches for neutralinos are presented. Prospects for upgrades of these facilities and for the LHC and linear collider are summarized. Most discussions are made in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model inspired by supergravity (MSUGRA). But alternatives such as gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB), anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB), models with R-parity violation and even alternatives to supersymmetry are also briefly considered.}
